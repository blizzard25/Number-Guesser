Simple program that is able to use the Chinese remainder theorem to "guess" the
number the user is thinking of

TO USE:
First think of a number between one and one hundred (this does not currently work
with numbers outside that range)

divide the number by three five and seven

take the remainder of this division and input into the appropriate text boxes

submit and let the program guess your number
